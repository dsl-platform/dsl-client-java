# DSL client - Java

## Introduction

DSL client is a set of core Java files used as compile target for [DSL Platform] [1].

If you are new to the DSL Platform, take a look at [introduction] [3] and check out [the tutorials] [4]. 
You can even [try it online] [5] (but not in Java).

## Why?

DSL client is compatible with [Revenj] [6] REST API. This means it can be used as Java/Android library for interaction with Revenj.

DSL client can also be used as fastest [JSON serializer] [7] for JVM.
